            <p>My name is Patti Rich, a teacher of the Law of Attraction, and supporter of spiritual growth. I hope by now you have heard of the Law of Attraction and maybe even understand a bit about how it works in helping us, as human beings, create more
              amazing and fulfilling lives for ourselves and others. If you haven't heard of it, let me take a moment to explain briefly. The Law of Attraction is basically summed up as, our thoughts and beliefs become our realities. What we think about, we bring
              about. Yes, the things we think about most often, along with what we believe about the things we think about, become what we see in our realities. The cool news is, that as we learn this and become aware of it, we can actually start making huge and
              amazing changes in our lives and the lives of others as well!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Let's take a moment to think about the fact that we can all pretty much agree that there are no two people on the planet who are living in the exact same reality. No, everyone sees "reality" from a slightly different perspective or maybe even
              completely different perspectives. We may agree on some things about reality, but there's definitely going to be some differences as well. Take for example, people you know who are primarily positive people vs. people who are primarily negative. They
              see their lives and surroundings or "realities" very differently. You might hear the more negative people saying things like, "The world is going to Hell in a handbasket." or, "Kids these days have no morals." But on the other hand you would probably
              hear the more positive people saying things like, "I see the world becoming a better place then it was before." or, "I see more people, and kids as well, doing good things for others." Now everyone can alternate between these beliefs, but most of us
              have a primary state of being either more positive or more negative. But what most people don't know, is that it's those thoughts and beliefs that are actually shaping their different realities. It is really what you are looking for, thinking about
              and believing, becomes what you will find more of in your own reality.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>When I first learned about the Law of Attraction five years ago, it sort of made a little sense, but I thought, "How can I be sure it is true?" I mean I had always thought that life was happening to me (the good and bad) rather than me having
              something to do with actually creating it and the way I see it. So I began my studying of the Law of Attraction with books and other people's blogs and YouTube videos. There is a plethora of information about it that I never knew existed. Many people
              sharing their personal stories about how it changed their lives. They eventually felt strongly called to share it with others, just as I feel now, myself. After realizing that by changing my thoughts and limiting beliefs about so many topics in my
              life, I began to truly see things in my life changing for the better!
